## üí° Design Assumptions

- All data is stored in memory using JavaScript Maps (no external DB).
- Each user is uniquely identified by their username.
- A poll contains a question and at least two unique, non-empty options.
- Votes are recorded as a map of `username ‚Üí option index`.
- A user may only vote once per poll.
- Only the poll creator is authorized to delete their poll.
- Zod is used for request validation on API endpoints.

### User Service
```ts
createUser(username: string): Promise<{ username: string }>
getUser(username: string): Promise<string | undefined>
voteOnPoll(id: string, username: string, optionId: number): Promise<Poll>
getVotedPollsByUser(username: string): Promise<Poll[]>
```

### Poll Service

createPoll({ creator, question, options }): Promise<Poll>
getPolls(): Promise<Poll[]>
getPollsByUser(username: string): Promise<Poll[]>
deletePoll(id: string, username: string): Promise<void>
```

### Poll Storage Interface
```ts
savePoll(poll): Promise<void>
getPoll(id): Promise<Poll | null>
deletePoll(id): Promise<boolean>
getAllPolls(): Promise<Poll[]>
getPollsByCreator(username): Promise<Poll[]>

## üîÅ Team Retrospective

### Reflections on Collaboration
We split responsibilities between backend logic, routing, validation and tests. GitHub was used for collaboration, and frequent updates were shared via group chat. Modular design helped us maintain clean separation of concerns and track code ownership.

### Lessons Learned on AI Usage
We used **ChatGPT** and **GitHub Copilot** to:
- Refactor files for modularity and readability
- Add and correct JSDoc documentation
- Structure Zod schema validation
- Generate and validate API documentation

The AI helped with speed and quality, but we made final architectural decisions and validations ourselves.
